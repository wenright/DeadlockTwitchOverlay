# Deadlock item overlay

## TODO
* only load overlay if current game is set to deadlock
* performance improvements
* allow double clicking to open stream in fullscreen (prevent overlay from taking pointer events outside of small area)
* poor item recognition for items that have cooldowns and are on cooldown
* Currently only loads on page refresh, should also load when switching streams


## Item issues
* "extra charge" shows +1% CDR instead of +1 charges
